## Notice

This buildpack was designed to only work the Tonsser API so don't expect it to
work with your project. However you're welcome to look at the change we've made
to make it work with Helix.

---

This is a Heroku buildpack for Rust with support for [cargo][]
and [rustup][], which seems to be the future of Rust deployment as of the
fall of 2016.  Features include:

- Caching of builds between deployments.
- Automatic updates to the latest stable Rust by default.
- Optional pinning of Rust to a specific version.
- Support for `export` so that other buildpacks can access the Rust
  toolchain.
- Support for compiling Rust-based extensions for projects written
  in other languages.

For an example project, see [heroku-rust-cargo-hello][].

## Using this buildpack

To deploy an application to Heroku, we recommend installing the [Heroku CLI][].

If you're creating a new Heroku application, `cd` to the directory
containing your code, and run:

```sh
heroku create --buildpack https://github.com/emk/heroku-buildpack-rust.git
```

This will only work if your application has a `Cargo.toml` and uses `git`.
If you want to set a particular name for application, see `heroku create
--help` first.

To use this as the buildpack for an existing application, run:

```sh
heroku buildpacks:set https://github.com/emk/heroku-buildpack-rust.git
```

You will also need to create a `Procfile` pointing to the release version of
your application, and commit it to `git`:

```Procfile
web: ./target/release/hello
```

To deploy your application, run:

```sh
git push heroku master
```

## Specifying which version of Rust to use

By default, your application will be built using the latest stable Rust.
Normally, this is pretty safe: New stable Rust releases have excellent
backwards compatibility.

But you may wish to use `nightly` Rust or to lock your Rust version to a
known-good configuration for more reproducible builds. To specify a specific
version of the toolchain, use a [`rust-toolchain`](https://github.com/rust-lang-nursery/rustup.rs#the-toolchain-file) file in the format rustup
uses.

Note: if you previously specified a `VERSION` variable in `RustConfig`, that will continue to work,
and will override a `rust-toolchain` file.

## Combining with other buildpacks

If you have a project which combines both Rust and another programming
language, you can insert this buildpack before your existing one as
follows:

```sh
heroku buildpacks:add --index 1 https://github.com/emk/heroku-buildpack-rust.git
```

If you have a valid `Cargo.toml` in your project, this is all you need to
do.  The Rust buildpack will run first, and your existing buildpack will
run second.


But if you only need Rust to build a particular Ruby gem, and you have no
top-level `Cargo.toml` file, you'll need to let the buildpack know to skip
the build stage.  You can do this by adding the following line to
`RustConfig`:

```sh
RUST_SKIP_BUILD=1
```

## Development notes

If you need to tweak this buildpack, the following information may help.

### Testing with Docker

To test changes to the buildpack using the included
`docker-compose-test.yml`, run:

```sh
./test_buildpack
```

Then make sure there are no Rust-related *.so files getting linked:

```sh
ldd heroku-rust-cargo-hello/target/release/hello
```

This uses the Docker image `heroku/cedar`, which allows us to test in an
official Cedar-like environment.

We also run this test automatically on Travis CI.
